# Automating-Nano-Optical-Measurements
This project is devised as a means to integrate the process of recording data through a Thorlabs CCS Spectrometer and motion through Thorlabs Nanomax Stage. the end result will be doing both these processes simulataneously thus being able to greatly simplify complicated measurement tasks.
